# Code-Refactor

##Task:
In this project I was tasked with synthesizing code to be more optimal. The main task was to use semantic code in order to
maximize SEO for the client's webpage.

##My approach:
Since the full page was coded with div's, I changed them with semantic tags that are more appropriate to the content they were displaying. In addition to the tags, the images had no alt text to describe them so alt text was added to each image for users that could not load the images. The css page was also edited to reduce unnecessary and redundant lines of code. In addition, the css page was reformatted in order of appearance. Overall the look of the page was not altered and the finished result is a page that is search engine optimized and more user friendly.
